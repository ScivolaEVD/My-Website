# My Website

### My name is Ethan VanDyke

I am a student at the University of Missouri. I made this for IT 1000. 
I am hoping to finish school in the next year or two, and then hopefully start paying off debt.
Hopefully these links can give you a slightly better idea of who I am and what I enjoy doing.
